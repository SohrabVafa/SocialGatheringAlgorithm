# SocialGatheringAlgorithm
A metaheuristic algorithm based on a population where the elements try to get closer to other elements in the population with better fitness and join them.

In this repository there are 3 versions of this algorithm:  
  1-SG algorithm  
  2-SG algorithm with Solis and Wets local search integrated  
  3-Modified SG algorithm to maintain more diversity  
  
The algorithms are made to work with the CEC2017 competition functions.
